- Interesting parallel between blacksmiths and software craftsmanship: to be an
effective blacksmith you need the science but also need art. Also, the history of
blacksmiths trade has seen an evolution from the blacksmith having to do 
everything (including creating the metal and coal) to specialising as technology
evolved and metal production was done by others.

- Good enough software is not good enough. Customers need to stop accepting crap
software, there are no excuses.

- The relationship between crafters and customers is crucial to yielding good 
software.

- Because their responsibility is on the line, crafters will not agree to unrealistic
deadlines. This also goes for lower quality software: a crafter will not accept
this compromise. THERE IS NO SHIPPING WITH KNOWN BUGS.

- Crafters carefully consider their potential customers, as bad customers can lead
to bad projects, hence bad reputation.

- Being held accountable also means being aware when a mistake is made and learning 
from it.

- In craftsmanship, small, evolving, reliable, quick to production applications 
are preferred to unstable feature rich mud-balls. It is easier to add functionality
to a solid application than to make a buggy, badly designed release stable.

- A long-standing relationship between Customer and Crafter also benefits the 
Customer, as it will take much less time for them to fix any problems, and it will
be much easier. 

- Open-source applications are and amazing example of how effective crafters can
be at maintenance; take for example emacs or Linux, which have been solid and 
steadily growing for decades.

- In open-source, becoming the maintainer of a project is superb for your reputation:
this is because, amongst other things, it shows that the previous maintainers and 
the core team trust you with the task.

- In software engineering it is quite the opposite: you get stuck in maintenance 
if you are not good enough at developing new applications.

- Small teams of skilful developers beat large teams of mediocre ones. 

- Software craftsmanship provides a real alternative to the world of disposable
software. It replaces it with solid, long-lasting crafted products.

- Good enough software is not good enough. Customers need to stop accepting crap
software, there are no excuses.

- The relationship between crafters and customers is crucial to yielding good 
software.

- Because their responsibility is on the line, crafters will not agree to unrealistic
deadlines. This also goes for lower quality software: a crafter will not accept
this compromise. THERE IS NO SHIPPING WITH KNOWN BUGS.

- Crafters carefully consider their potential customers, as bad customers can lead
to bad projects, hence bad reputation.

- Being held accountable also means being aware when a mistake is made and learning 
from it.

- Software craftsmanship is about getting the job done. Reputation is  measured 
based on the quality of completed projects rather than processes.
- A crafter is chosen by recommendation and because of their individual skills 
rather than standardised qualifications. Passing an exam is not a sufficient 
condition for being a good developer.
- Personal recommendation is way more effective than standard licences/diplomas,etc.
The crafter's responsibility is on the line when they recommend someone, so they
will be very careful in who they recommend.

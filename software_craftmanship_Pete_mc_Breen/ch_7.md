- The relationship between crafter and user is very important. The user knows they
can go back to the crafter to ask for modifications; they can appreciate the work
done so far, which gives the crafter a sense of appreciation, fuelling the 
relationship and a sense of pride in what they are doing. Partnerships are very 
important in craftsmanship.

- Physical products are expensive to craft, as each has to be paid for by the user.
So it's normal to accept trade-offs between quality and price. For example, we are
fine with buying clothing that comes in standard sizes as it is close enough to 
our actual size and it saves a lot of money to only have a few standard designs.
The same is not true for software, as reproducing one well crafted piece of 
software is extremely easy.

- Interesting point: designing a product for the masses should not be guided by
making it so that most people like it. It works much better if a few love it.

- Developers should be responsible and accountable for their work. The author 
describes this a 'signing' our work. Feeling responsible and accountable for our
work makes us pay more attention and put more pride in what we do.

- A relationship between users and developers is very important and one that 
enables hard decisions to be easily made when necessary.
